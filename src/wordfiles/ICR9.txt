NO TELL
EARN A REST
A CATS TAIL
A CORE ROLE
LET IT REST
TELL IT ALL
NOT ONE IOTA
EASE INTO IT
A COST I LOST
I LOST A RACE
TEAR IN A TIRE
A SCAN AT NOON
EAT IT OR ELSE
A TEN CENT LOAN
TOO SORE TO SIT
I CANTÂ CARE LESS
ONE ACRE TO A LOT
I LOST A TEST LIST
SLOT CARS ARE COOL
LETS RACE TO A TREE
IT ISNT A REAL NAIL
ITS TOO LATE TO EAT
ITS A REAL RAT RACE
A LENS CAN TEAR
A LION IS NOT AN ANT
A COOT SAT ON A SEAT
ITS A REAL TEST TONE
OIL IN A CAN
LIE ON A COT IN RAIN 
A LAST ONE CAN ROLL IN
A NEAT AREA TO SAIL IN
LAST ONE TO LOSE A RACE
CORN IN AN AREA
IS IT A TALL TALE OR NOT
LETS SIT ON A SEAT TO EAT
A COOL CAT ATE A RATS TAIL
