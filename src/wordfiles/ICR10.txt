TALL TALES
COST RATIO
STAIR RAIL
EARN A REST
A CATS TAIL
A CORE ROLE
LET IT REST
TELL IT ALL
TO TELL
STEER A CAR
AN EAR CANAL
A LATE RISER
NOT ONE IOTA
EASE INTO IT
ERASE IT ALL
ERICA IS NICE
TOAST A SCONE
A COST I LOST
I LOST A RACE
LEARN TO EARN
TEAR IN A TIRE

A SCAN AT NOON
EAT IT OR ELSE

ITS NOT REAL
TOTAL SOLAR
A TRACE TO A SCENT
RAISE COSTS SOON
SAIL ON AN OCEAN
I CANT CARE LESS
A SEAL SAT CLOSE
NO SNAIL IS CLEAN
IT IS NOT A STONE
SAIL ON AN OCEAN 
A STAIN ON A COAT
ONE ACRE TO A LOT
A REAL TALL CRANE
LETS RAISE A TOAST
RIOTS ARE NOT COOL
ALL ACRES IN A LOT
I LOST A TEST LIST
SLOT CARS ARE COOL
SIT IN A TRAIN CAR
IT IS NOT AN ERROR
LETS RACE TO A TREE
SORT COINS A LOT
IT ISNT A REAL NAIL
I CAN LEARN TO SAIL
ITS TOO LATE TO EAT
ITS A REAL RAT RACE
A LENS CAN TEAR
A LION IS NOT AN ANT
CAROL ACES ALL TESTS
A COOT SAT ON A SEAT
ITS A TREAT TO TRAIN
AT LEAST I CAN LEARN

SCOOT INTO A REAR SEAT
A NEAT AREA TO SAIL IN

TIN CANS ARE IN A STORE
LAST ONE TO LOSE A RACE
CORN IN AN AREA
AS I SEE IT I CAN LEARN
RAIN OR SLEET ISNT NEAT
I CANT STEAL TESLA TIRES
IS IT A TALL TALE OR NOT
LIONS CAN REACT TO NOISE
LETS SIT ON A SEAT TO EAT
A COOL CAT ATE A RATS TAIL
STAN CRIES IN CASE IT RAINS
I CANT TAN IN RAIN OR SLEET
RAIN NOR SLEET NOR LATE AT NITE
TEN CENT COINS ARE AT LEAST A START
